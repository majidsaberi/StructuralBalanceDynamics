# Dynamic Structural Balance Analysis in Functional Brain Networks

This repository implements the computational framework developed for investigating **Structural Balance Theory (SBT)** in **dynamic brain networks**  (**Saberi, M. et al., 2025**).

The codes estimate how patterns of positive and negative interactions among brain regions form and evolve over time, quantifying the **stability**, **tension**, and **transitions** of triadic relationships.

This framework extends SBT to dynamic brain networks to address a fundamental open question that, until now, had not been empirically tested in the brain:  
> Are balanced triads genuinely stable, and are imbalanced triads transient?

This project introduces and implements a **dynamic framework** that directly tests these assumptions using resting-state fMRI data.  
It provides all computational tools required to reproduce the analyses described in the manuscript, including computation of **triadic lifetimes**, **peak energies**, **surrogate modeling**, and **triadic transition mapping**.

Beyond the analyses presented in the project, this framework is designed as a **general-purpose platform** for dynamic brain network research. Its modular design allows researchers to apply the same analytical pipeline to other datasets and scientific questions involving **time-resolved functional connectivity**, **neural stability**, and **higher-order network organization**. The approach is not limited to healthy resting-state fMRI but can be extended to examine **brain dynamics in various cognitive states, developmental stages, or neurological and psychiatric disorders**. By adapting the input time series or parcellation scheme, the platform can quantify how triadic balance, stability, and tension evolve under different experimental or clinical conditions.

## Background

Structural Balance Theory, originally developed in social network science, can be applied to brain connectivity to characterize  
how cooperative and antagonistic interactions among brain regions organize the network over time.  
Each triplet of regions (a *triad*) can be classified as follows:

| Triad | Configuration | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| +++ | all positive | Balanced |
| −+− | two negative, one positive | Balanced |
| +−+ | two positive, one negative | Imbalanced |
| −−− | all negative | Imbalanced |

This framework provides a dynamic approach for testing whether **balanced triads persist longer** than **imbalanced ones**,  an empirical test of a central prediction of Structural Balance Theory.
